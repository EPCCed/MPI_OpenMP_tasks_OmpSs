# N-body

## Introduction
An N-body simulation numerically approximates the evolution of a system of
bodies in which each body continuously interacts with every other body.  A
familiar example is an astrophysical simulation in which each body represents a
galaxy or an individual star, and the bodies attract each other through the
gravitational force.

N-body simulation arises in many other computational science problems as well.
For example, protein folding is studied using N-body simulation to calculate
electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Turbulent fluid flow simulation and
global illumination computation in computer graphics are other examples of
problems that use N-body simulation.
