#include <mpi.h> // is there a way to forward declare mpi types?

// The combination of group (comm), tag, and neighbor
// should be unique for each connection.
//
// In a Cartesian topology, the challenges to this uniqueness
// occur for periodic boundary conditions when there is a
// dimension only 1 or 2 processes thick.
//
// In the 1-process-thick case, we can forgo MPI communication in
// that direction altogether.  But in the 2-process-thick case,
// we need to make a distinction between upward and downward
// channels of communication.  Distinguishing upward and downward
// directions is sufficient for any topology based on convex MPI
// subdomains, since in this case two subdomains can share at
// most two faces.  Any mechanism for distinguishing upward and
// downward directions for a pair of subdomains is sufficient;
// one way is to compare the positions of the centroids, first in
// the x direction, then in the y direction, and then in the z
// direction.  One might use tag=1 for downward communication and
// tag=2 for upward communication, and use MPI_COMM_WORLD for the
// group.
