1) load all the data in MATLAB workspace using parsek2D.m
2) execute analysis tools, ie pdf.m, energy.m, A_jmovie,...

****************************************************
parsek2D.m to load all the data in MATLAB workspace

1) you need to set the directory with the data in parsek2D.m, changing the variable results_dir at line 32

ie: results_dir='/home/markidis/dist001/parsek2D/results'

2) if the simulation is running and you want to check the intermediate results, you need to open the restart file, that is updated every x cycle. To open the intermediate results, change the variable processor_name, from:

processor_name=[results_dir '/proc']; ---> to read the file with the final results

to:

processor_name=[results_dir '/restart']; ---> to read the file with the intermediate results

Restart files contain only information about E, B, species density, and particles positions.

3) change the variable list you want to load in the MATLAB workspace (line 44). For instance if you are only interested in EM fields you can just, load E and B, as

ie: variable_list=' B E';

or: variable_list='k_energy e_energy b_energy x v q';
to load energies, particle positions and charges

The list is:
B, E -> magnetic and electric field
A, phi -> potentials
J, rho -> current and number densities
pressure -> magnetic pressure
x, v, ID, q -> position , velocity, ID, q
k_energy -> kinetic energy
E_energy, B_energy -> electric and magnetic energy

**********************************************
After you used parsek2D.m, Analysis tool:

pdf.m --> 2D particle distribution function plot
energy --> plot of the energies history
parsek2D_fft --> Fourier analysis of the EM field
A_j_movie --> Magnetic field lines and current density magnitude history
