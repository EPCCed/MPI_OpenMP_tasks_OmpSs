// Increasing the number of unique IDs to 2^64 would be possible
// using uint64_t or via large double precision IDs created by
// grouping processors e.g. into 2048 different groups each
// having a unique exponent.
//
// Idea of how to assign unique double precision IDs
// using most of the double precision bits:
//
//   MPI_Comm_rank returns int, so assume that
//   there are at most 2^31 processors.
//   Putting 2^30 processors in 2^10 groups
//   means that there are 2^20 processors in a group.
//   let group_idx range from 1 to 2^10.
//   let ID_increment = group_idx.
//   set counter as if there are only 2^20 processors.
//   then multiply counter by group_idx.
//
// But I need to be careful about the sign bits
// in the mantissa and exponent.
//
// We can work out the details when we really need more
// than 2^53 unique particle IDs.
//
// Points relevant to use of float versus integer keys in code:
// * In particle sorting and communication, performance
//   imperatives dictate against special handling of the ID
//   field.  Casting allows use of a double field to store a
//   64-bit integer.  Correct communication would require the
//   expense of calls to MPI_Pack, though I think that this would
//   only be an issue in the unlikely event of communicating
//   between big-endian and little-endian architectures.
// * double supports consecutive integers up to 2^53.
//   (uint64_t supports consecutive integers up to 2^64.)
// * double can still represent up to 2^64 distinct IDs
//   if one gives up on the IDs being consecutive integers,
//   and 2^62 of these values are positive integers.
// * There is wider support for double precision floats
//   than for 64-bit integers (e.g. among legacy codes,
//   architectures, and databases, which apparently allow use of
//   floating point numbers as keys in key-value pairs).  For
//   example, on my laptop (which has a 32-bit architecture),
//   int64_t and long long are simply mapped to int, but double
//   precision is supported -- though it's unlikely that we would
//   want more than 4 billion particles on a 32-bit architecture.
//
// Considerations relevant to use of float versus integer keys
// in saved data (a separable issue):
// * what kind of support is provided by scientific databases
//   for integer versus double-precision keys?
// * use of double means that there is no need for a separate
//   HDF5 method to save the ID field.
